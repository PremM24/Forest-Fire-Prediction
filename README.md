# Forest-Fire-Prediction
My proposed system, utilizing machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, predicts fire occurrence percentage of forest fire based on temperature, oxygen, and humidity. This aids resource allocation and mitigation efforts crucial for forest preservation.
